# Write a special comment to indicate a Python source code file is in unicode.

#MY SOLUTION:

# -*- coding: encoding -*-

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Line 1 is the syntax (correct format) for coding/encoding declaration.
Line 2 is how you actually indicate how the source code is encoded.

I did not know this on my own. The course I took didn't teach me this.
I had to lookup the solution online and that's what I copied and pasted as my solution.
I learned something new with this question.
This is the first question that totally had me stumped from the jump.
I wrote down this question number.
After I'm done with all the other exercies, I'm going to come back to this to see if I remember.
That obviously won't be a part of this solution, I just had to share, in case someone else was stumped
like me, and I save you the hassle of having to look up this answer.
There is no alternate answer. This is what it is.
